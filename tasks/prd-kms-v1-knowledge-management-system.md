# Product Requirements Document: KMS-V1 Knowledge Management System

## Introduction/Overview

The KMS-V1 (Knowledge Management System Version 1) is a comprehensive AI-powered knowledge management and case similarity search platform designed to address critical challenges in HPE's support ecosystem. The system leverages vector embeddings, LLM technology, and cloud-native architecture to provide intelligent case resolution assistance, knowledge discovery, and automated similarity matching.

**Problem Statement:** Engineers currently face significant challenges including lengthy case resolution times due to difficulty finding similar historical cases, siloed knowledge that's hard to discover, and inconsistent case resolution quality across different support teams. These issues result in increased support costs, longer customer wait times, and suboptimal resolution outcomes.

**Goal:** Build a scalable, AI-powered knowledge management system that enables support engineers and knowledge managers to quickly find similar cases, access relevant resolutions, and maintain high-quality knowledge repositories with 90%+ accuracy in case similarity matching.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Case Resolution Time:** Decrease average case resolution time by 30-40% through intelligent similarity search
2. **Improve Knowledge Discovery:** Enable seamless access to historical cases, CFIs, and engineering documentation
3. **Enhance Resolution Quality:** Provide AI-generated resolution suggestions with 90%+ accuracy
4. **Replace Legacy Systems:** Successfully replace Coveo Case Search with enhanced capabilities
5. **Achieve High User Adoption:** Reach 80%+ adoption rate among support engineers within 6 months
6. **Ensure Scalability:** Handle 2+ years of SFDC case data with sub-second query response times
